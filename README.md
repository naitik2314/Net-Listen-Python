# Net-Listen-Python
Just think of it, you are in a live in relationship, and your better half has the house keys(Obviosuly), so when do you know that she is gonna surprise you, or you are scared that you are in a middle of something, and she might catch you(Don't even think of cheating, I am talking about having your boys group meetup, or you are wearing your Girlfriend's makeup etc etc), so this project listens your Wifi, and as soon as your partner comes nearby your home, the phone is gonna connect to the wifi network, and a new IP address will be connected, and this address doesn't change, so you will be notified that your partner is nearby. Thank me later.
